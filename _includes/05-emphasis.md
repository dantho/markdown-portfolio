I think emphasis should be used **sparingly**.
That's how you assure *good style*

GitHub's markdown uses TWO _asterisks_ OR _underscores_ for **bold**,
and one for _italics_, but I like using _underscores_ for italics and asterisks for bold,
so I just need to remember to use **TWO* for **bold*
